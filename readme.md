### Objectives

* Make an image slider using JavaScript
* Get reps with JavaScript, raw CSS, [JS event data](https://api.jquery.com/event.data/) and [CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions).

The design team just sent you an email! They provided an image or two (check `/img`) and have requested the following:

```
Hey developer!

Attached please find a JPEG that needs to be converted into an image slider.

When a user clicks a button that corresponds to a bird, we would like to see that bird in the JPEG displayed on an iPhone screen so our users have a nice interface to look at.

Oh, and the images should have a smooth transition from one bird to the next.

The blue parula bird should have a green background, the pink macaw bird should have a blue background, and the green tucan should have a pink background. Can the background color transition smoothly, too?

We put together some HTML and a bit of CSS. Can you finish the CSS for us and implement some JavaScript to accomplish what we need?

Thanks!
Design Team
